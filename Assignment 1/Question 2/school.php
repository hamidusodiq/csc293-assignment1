            <h1>University <span>experience</span></h1>
            <p>
               I gained admission into the University of Ibadan in 2020 to study computer science. The experience so far has been rewarding though with rough patches from time to time. It took a lot of time and effort to adjust to the transition from secondary school while living with my parents, to being alone in the University.

                one of the challenges of this upheavel is the heavy academic workload that comes with being in an higer institution of learning. Due to this, i've had to improve on my time-management skills and study habits. I've found it pertinet
                to study everyday; not just regularly but consistently. Looking back 3 years ago, i can confidently say i've improved in this aspect.

                Another challenge i face is adjusting to the hostel environment. Though the benefits of staying in school campus are immense e.g short distance to lecture halls, security, e.t.c, the everyday struggles one has to face is very exhausting. One has to struggle to fetch water, bath, dry clothes, just to mention a few.

                Despite the challenges, i have benefitted a lot. i have been able to improve on important skills such as time-management, decision-making,critical-thinking, and communication-skills
